  <h3>Unlike the drone pilots these pilots are in a combat plane that could be taken down and the pilots are risinking their lives
    but they are also better for some occasions. Not all pilots fly a combat plane. Some fly cargo planes to transport things to differnt
    states and contries.</h3>
